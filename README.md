# F1 Statistics
A program that compares the performance between drivers in a given season using data from the Ergast Developer API.
This is just a small summer project to allow me to teach myself and experiment with python

### Race results
The program can compare the race results between two selected drivers for a given season. For example, if I was to compare Max Verstappen with Charles Leclerc the cmp_race_results() function would return "max_verstappen 5-2 leclerc" along with a list of their finishing positions repectively. (as of the 2019 Canadian GP)
